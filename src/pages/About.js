        In the context of rapidly advancing science and technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven its exceptional potential across various fields, from healthcare and education to agriculture and the environment. Notably, the application of AI in public health care and protection is gaining significant attention, helping to address urgent challenges in daily life. One of the most noteworthy issues is rabies in dogsâ€”a dangerous disease that can be transmitted to humans, severely impacting public health and safety.

Rabies poses a major threat to many countries, especially in areas with large populations of pets or free-roaming dogs. Early detection of rabies symptoms and the timely implementation of intervention measures not only protect pets but also significantly reduce the risk of transmission to humans. However, traditional rabies monitoring and warning systems often face limitations in terms of time, accuracy, and resources.

In response to this situation, the project "Using AI for Rabies Detection in Dogs" has been undertaken to research and develop an artificial intelligence-based system that supports the analysis of dog behavior and symptoms to detect the early risk of rabies. By combining machine learning, computer vision, and data analysis algorithms, this system promises to provide an effective solution, contributing to public health protection and improving quality of life.

This report will present in detail the process of research, design, implementation, and evaluation of the system, while highlighting the potential of AI in addressing practical issues. We hope that this project will not only bring scientific value but also open up opportunities for the application of AI technology in future pet health management.
